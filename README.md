# Tennis Court WebGL_Project
This WebGL Project for my Computer Graphics class.

It was developed with the [Three.js] (https://threejs.org/) library. 

This project consists of developing a 3D scene making use of the concepts learnt in my Computer Graphics course.

The scene I chose is a classic exhibition match court in which the court floats in water.
An example of this court can be seen [here] (http://newsliteimgs.s3.amazonaws.com/110104_tennis2.jpg).

A preview of my scene:

The complete scene can be seen in [GithubPages] (https://stapia24.github.io/WebGL_Project/)
